	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

	<!-- First paragraph about Time Complexity -->
	<p>
		Time complexity is a way to measure how an algorithm's running time grows with input size. 
		An efficient algorithm has better time complexity, making it suitable for handling large datasets.
	</p>

	<!-- Second paragraph about Space Complexity -->
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires for its execution. 
		For example, certain algorithms use O(n) space depending on the size of the input data.
